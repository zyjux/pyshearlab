    Compute a 2D shearlet system.

        shearletSystem = SLgetShearletSystem2D(useGPU, rows, cols,
                        nScales)

                        nScales, shearLevels, full,
                        directionalFilter, quadratureMirrorFilter)

    Input:

        useGPU: Logical value, determines if the
                shearlet system is constructed on the GPU.
        rows:    Number of rows.
        cols:    Number of columns.
        nScales: Number of scales of the desired shearlet system.
                 Has to be >= 1.
        shearLevels: A 1xnScales sized array, specifying the level of
                     shearing occuring on each scale. Each entry of
                     shearLevels has to be >= 0. A shear level of K
                     means that the generating shearlet is sheared
                     2^K times in each direction for each cone.
                     For example: If nScales = 3 and
                     shearLevels = [1 1 2], the shearlet system will
                     contain
                     (2*(2*2^1+1))+(2*(2*2^1+1))+(2*(2*2^2+1))=38
                     shearlets (omitting the lowpass shearlet and
                     translation). Note that it is recommended not
                     to use the full shearlet system but to omit
                     shearlets lying on the border of the second
                     cone as they are only slightly different from
                     those on the border of the first cone. The
                     default value is ceil((1:nScales)/2).
        full:       Logical value that determines whether a full
                    shearlet system is computed or if shearlets
                    lying on the border of the second cone are
                    omitted. The default and recommended value
                    is 0.
        directionalFilter: A 2D directional filter that serves as the
                    basis of the directional 'component' of the
                    shearlets.
                    The default choice is
                        modulate2(dfilters('dmaxflat4','d'),'c').
                    For small sized inputs or very large systems, the
                    default directional filter might be too large. In
                    this case, it is recommended to use
                             modulate2(dfilters('cd','d'),'c').
        quadratureMirrorFilter: A 1D quadrature mirror filter
                    defining the wavelet 'component' of the
                    shearlets. The default choice is
                    [0.0104933261758410,-0.0263483047033631,-0.0517766952966370,

                    Other QMF filters can be genereted with
                    MakeONFilter.

    Output:

        shearletSystem: A structure containing the specified shearlet
                        system.
        ["shearlets"]: A X x Y x N array of N 2D shearlets in the
                        frequency domain where X and Y denote the
                        size of each shearlet. To get the i-th
                        shearlet in the time domain, use
        fftshift(ifft2(ifftshift(shearletSystem.shearlets(:,:,i)))).
                    Each Shearlet is centered at floor([X Y]/2)+1.
        ["size"]:       The size of each shearlet in the system.
        ["shearLevels"]: The respective input argument is stored
                        here.
        ["full"]:       The respective input argument is stored here.
        ["nShearlets"]: Number of shearlets in the
                        shearletSystem["shearlets"] array. This
                        number also describes the redundancy of
                        the system.
        ["shearletdIdxs"]: A Nx3 array, specifying each shearlet in
                            the system in the format
                            [cone scale shearing] where N denotes
                            the number of shearlets. The vertical
                            cone in the time domain is indexed by
                            1 while the horizontal cone is indexed
                            by 2.
                            Note that the values for scale and
                            shearing are limited by specified
                            number of scales and shaer levels. The
                            lowpass shearlet is indexed by [0 0 0].
        ["dualFrameWeights"]: A XxY matrix containing the absolute
                            and squared sum over all shearlets
                            stored in shearletSystem.shearlets.
                            These weights are needed to compute
                            the dual frame during reconstruction.
        ["RMS"]:            A 1xnShearlets array containing the root
                            mean squares (L2-norm divided by
                            sqrt(X*Y)) of all shearlets stored in
                            shearletSystem["shearlets"]. These
                            values can be used to normalize
                            shearlet coefficients to make them
                            comparable.
        ["useGPU"]:         Logical value. Tells if the shearlet
                            system is stored on the GPU.
                            Right now this is ignored since no GPU
                            implementation is done yet.

    Example 1:
    compute a standard shearlet system of four scales

        shearletSystem = SLgetShearletSystem2D(0,512,512,4)

    Example 2:
    compute a full shearlet system of four scales

                                        [1 1 2 2],1)

    Example 3:
    compute a shearlet system with high shear levels for small sized data
    using a non-default directional filter.

        directionalFilter = modulate2(dfilters('cd','d'),'c')
        shearletSystem = SLgetShearletSystem2D(0,256,256,4,
